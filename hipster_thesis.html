      <h1>Hipsters</h1>
      <p class="by_line">By Harsh Patel</p>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The term was coined during the jazz age, when "hip" emerged as an adjective to describe aficionados of the growing scene.[9] Although the adjective's exact origins are disputed, some say it was a derivative of "hop", a slang term for opium, while others believe it comes from the West African word hipi, meaning "to open one's eyes".[9] Another argument suggests the term derives from the practice of lying on one's hip while smoking opium.[12] The ultimate meaning of "hip", attested as early as 1902, is "aware" or "in the know". Conversely, the antonym unhip connotes those who are unaware of their surroundings, also including those who are opposed to hipness.</p>
      <h2>What the Heck is a Hipster?</h2>
      <p>The term in its current usage first appeared in the 1990s and became particularly prominent in the 2000s,[8] being derived from earlier movements in the 1940s.[9] Members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture">subculture</a> do not self-identify as hipsters, and the word hipster is often used as a pejorative to describe someone who is overly trendy or effete.[10][6] Some analysts contend that the notion of the contemporary hipster is actually a myth created by marketing.[11]</p>
